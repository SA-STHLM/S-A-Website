      <div>
    	<span class="font__small color__gray">
    	When developing websites for our clients, we use WordPress for content management. The reason why we use and prefer WordPress is due to its simplicity and short learning curve. We are unforunately not able to develop websites with another content management system, but we can recommend great developers for you.

      <h5 class="font__light"><span class="accordion__number">02</span> Do you teach WordPress?</h5>
      <div>
    	<span class="font__small color__gray">
    	Sort of, we always hand over a specially made "How to" guide to all of our clients. The guide is made solely for the specific website that we have developed. Most of our clients find WordPress so easy to use - that they never even look at the guide.

      <h5 class="font__light"><span class="accordion__number">03</span> Are your websites responsive and SEO optimized?</h5>
      <div>
    	<span class="font__small color__gray">
    	All of our websites are responsive and tested on numerous devices - from desktop screens, small laptops, tablets and the most common smartphones. All of our designs are based on Twitter Bootstraps Grid system, which basically is a safe shot to produce responsive websites. <br><br>
      We are not an SEO agency and have therefor little knowledge about SEO. What we do know is how to optimize the code so that search engines index the website properly. All websites are delivered SEO ready - but we are not able to help you on keyword / content optimization and similar services.

      <div>
    	<span class="font__small color__gray">
    	 Yes. We will always do our best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it is important to have things written down so that both parties know what's what. Before every project we kindly ask our clients to sign a contract. This contract is a formal agreement - written in simple English without any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. We are in no desire to trick you into signing something you will later regret. What we do want is what's best for both parties, now and in the future.
